# Spock
# Spock Spock is a project aimed at making visual projects with Vulkan and C++ much easier to manage. It wraps up the Vulkan API in bite sized and easy to use classes that make constructing Vulkan pipelines as easy as creating 3 objects.  Spock uses The GL Math Library (GLM) for vectors and matrices and GLFW to handle the creation of windows and display surfaces.
